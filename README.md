# Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status.

## Data Cleaning
The first phase of the project involves data cleaning, where missing values and inconsistencies are addressed. Missing values are imputed using appropriate methods, and unnecessary columns are removed to create a streamlined dataset. The goal is to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis while preserving the integrity of the original information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, we delve into the dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts are created to explore relationships between variables. We analyze factors like passenger class, age, gender, and fare to understand their impact on survival. This process helps us identify trends, correlations, and potential outliers.

The project provides valuable insights into the Titanic dataset, offering a comprehensive view of passenger demographics and their survival outcomes. By cleaning the data and conducting EDA, we gain a solid foundation for further analysis and modeling.
